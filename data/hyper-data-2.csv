My name is Mathilde, I’m 25 and I’m from Paris. I am currently a freelance digital project manager. I also work for a company that sells and trains people to data blending and visualisation softwares (I made my first tutorial last week, if you wanna hear my sweet voice it is right here > http://bit.ly/1W29HrQ). Joining Hyper Island’s MA in Digital Experience Design is an important moment for me. It is putting together my interest for societal topics (I studied political sciences), UX research and my love for digital arts, so I am really happy to be part of the MA. After Hyper Island, I hope I can contribute to the design of beautiful immersive experience in relation to education. I really believe that sensorial design with regards to (binaural!) sound and lighting will be the next big thing and will complement the intellectual approach that we currently have to learning. This will dramatically augment our understanding of the world and I hope to be part of that adventure. What is most precious to me is harmony in my relationships with people, which I find through practising meditation and…listening to techno & house music (yes! both can be combined, actually I find them quite complementary). Actually my love for immersive experiences probably comes from festivals/clubs of which scenographies just blew my mind (had you been there > http://bit.ly/1QOekV6, maybe you would have felt the same?). I did house/flatsharing for three years while I was at uni. What I like about house-sharing is to have someone to share a kind word with, when things go well or less well, during a long conversation or just when bumping into each other in the staircase. If you want to go clubbing, I’m always up for it, but if you want to stay home, meditate or have a cup of tea watching random YouTube videos, I’m also in. Exploring the city and finding out about unexpected places is also very exciting.",,DXD,,

I am from Colombia, but for the last 12 years have lived in South Africa. I am an anthropologist by training and work as a UX consultant at a management consulting firm.

Just wanted to add that I've done shared living for the past 7 years in several different countries and it's always been fun and conflict free, so I guess I get along well with people.

I do clean after myself and expect the same from others (but I am not the OCD kind ;) I am not looking for a party house - when it's party time, I'd rather go out.

I worked in social innovation and digital marketing + other summer jobs in Sofia, Munich, Ibiza, Silicon Valley & Ireland. I speak Bulgarian, German & English. Why DXD -  connecting a long-time interest in design with patterns from my experience and future vision. I am passionate for social & gendered innovation, socio-cultural identities, behavioral & cognitive psychology, human-centered design, UX. My ideal position after HI would be with an organization using design methods to craft innovative digital solutions to social challenges or public services - aiding the digital transformation of government systems. Why HI - the community, alternative teaching methods, mentorship & the non-standardised selection of students - looking for unique potential & diversity. What makes me happy and enthusiastic - collaborating with committed, smart people on cool projects that matter, globe trotting, being in nature, working out & connecting with people on a deeper level. A great housemate’s first words after moving in: “Let’s go get a blender for the house and yoga mats!” I’m a foodie and like to cook at home & share. I don’t usually watch TV (unless it is the show Silicon Valley) but I’d love to hang out together at home / working / sharing stories & ideas. I am a bit on the introverted side and  need chill/alone time too every now and then - I hope housemates won’t take it as separatism :) I am into house music and occasionally treat myself to a good party, but going out clubbing just for the sake of it is not really my thing. I do mindfulness practice & yoga and having a nurturing, zen-friendly environment at home would be fantastic to maintain the momentum! Working out is very important to me too - I enjoy a morning run & gym. Non-smoker, but tolerant Anything else: I like sarcastic humor and <3 someecards. I’m a BIG Ryanair fan - weekend in Portugal anyone??",,DXD,Jan.7,

BA in Communications and Advertising, also studied cooking, photography, and account planning at Miami Ad School in Buenos Aires. Started as a junior copywriter in FCB Mayo; currently a senior planner at McCann Erickson Lima, and teaching the Advertising Strategies course at a local college. Consider myself responsible and curious, always reading new things, looking for new places to eat, classes to take, I’m up for anything, but a good conversation with great homemade food will be just fine. It was a difficult choice to embark on this adventure, since it meant to end many things and projects, leave friends and family; I took it a as a call. I’ve always liked to create experiences, finding joy in watching friends or even strangers having a great time (Probably the reason why I enjoy so much cooking). Hyper is the time and place for me to embrace that, learn something new that can help me achieve the best possible future, work on my weaknesses, make great friends, fail, get up and practice every day. I don’t know you all very well, but can be sure we share same goals and expectations (I sense the force is strong in this group), will be more than happy to learn from all of you, but, since winter is coming, my perfect roommate will just need to like one thing…",£500,DXD,1/13/2016,https://pe.linkedin.com/in/renzovallejo/en

That's what I do stand for. Since my early career age I've been oriented for both problem-solving (operational level: executing design projects) and problem-framing (strategic level: do that what is necessary to have better decisions).
